CLEAN ARCHITECTURE:

- Software design philosphy by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob).
- Separation of concerns: Build scalable, maintainable, testable applications.
- Dependency rule: Dependencies point inward (Dependency Inversion). Outer layers can depend on inner layers, but inner layers should never know anything about outer layers. Loose coupling.
- Domain first, at the center.

Layers: Onion architecture (concentric circles)
Layer 1 - Frameworks & Drivers (outermost)
Layer 2 - Interface Adapters
Layer 3 - Use Cases (Application Business Rules)
Layer 4 - Entities - Enterprise Business Rules (innermost)

Project Folder Structure:
lib:

1. core: reusable utilities (network, errors, constants, routes, helpers).
2. features: feature-based modules (login, checkout, payments, etc.).

feature:

1. presentation: Bloc, Pages, Widgets
2. domain: Usecases, Entities, Repositories
3. data: Datasources, Models, Repository Implementations
4. feature-level dependency injection file

Presentation layer:

1. Pages: screen-level UI.
2. Widgets: reusable UI components.
3. Bloc: Widgets dispatch events to Bloc and Bloc emits states back to widgets. event => bloc => state

- Bloc calls usecase.
- UI logic stays thin; business logic stays out of widgets.

Domain layer:

1. UseCases: single responsibility classes with a call() method.
2. Repositories (abstract): define contracts, return Future<Either<Failure, Entity>>.
3. Entities: plain Dart classes representing business objects (no JSON, no framework code).

- Independent of framework.
- Key principle: Domain depends on nothing; everything depends on domain.
- Repositories bridge Domain and Data layers

UseCase Pattern

- Input: Params or NoParams from Bloc.
- Output: Either<Failure, Entity>.
- Encapsulates one specific business action (e.g., GetUser, Login, FetchOrders).

Data layer:

1. Repository (Implements repository contracts from domain): Convert Models <=> Entities. Handle Left(Failure) and Right(Data) responses
2. Models: Extend Entities. Contain fromJson, toJson, and factory constructors
3. Datasources: handle API calls, caching, database access.

Dependency Flow: Presentation => Domain <= Data

Data Flow:
UI => Events => BLoC => Use Cases => Repository => Data Sources
UI <= States <= BLoC <= Entities <= Repository <= Data Sources

TDD (Test-Driven Development) Workflow:

1. Write tests before implementation.
2. Mirror lib/ structure inside test/.
3. Use Arrange => Act => Assert.
4. Mock dependencies with Mockito.
5. JSON fixtures provide predictable dummy data for tests.

Key Libraries:

1. get_it => dependency injection (service locator).
2. flutter_bloc => state management.
3. equatable => value equality for entities and states.
4. dartz => functional programming (Either, Left, Right).
5. http, data_connection_checker_nulls => remote API handling.
6. shared_preferences => local caching.
