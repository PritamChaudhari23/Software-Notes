MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER:

- MVC is a design pattern that separates an application into Model, View, and Controller.
- The Model manages data, business rules, and application logic.
- Models are typically defined using Mongoose, which maps MongoDB documents to JavaScript objects.
- The Model handles database operations like CRUD, schema validation, and business logic.
- MongoDB’s schema-less nature fits well with MVC, allowing flexible model evolution.
- The same Model can be reused for multiple Views, such as web pages and API responses.
- The View is responsible only for presenting data to the user.
- Views are built using HTML and CSS, often with templating engines like EJS or Handlebars.
- Client-side JavaScript enhances the View with dynamic behavior and DOM manipulation.
- The Controller handles user input and coordinates between the Model and View.
- Controllers receive requests from the frontend, process data, and return responses or rendered views.
- In a Node.js application, Express acts as the Controller layer, handling routes and HTTP requests.
- Middleware in Express integrates smoothly with MVC for authentication, logging, and validation.
- MVC helps keep routing logic separate from database queries, improving maintainability.
- Using MVC in Express makes APIs cleaner and more modular, especially for RESTful services.
- This separation improves code organization and readability.
- MVC makes applications easier to maintain and scale, making it easier to add new features or endpoints.
- Overall, MVC enables clean architecture, faster development, and easier collaboration.
