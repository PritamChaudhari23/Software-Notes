CONTAINERS:

- Virtual Machines [Application, Dependencies, Guest OS] -> Hypervisor -> Infrastructure/Hardware
- Containers [Application, Dependencies] -> Container Engine/Platform/Docker -> Host OS -> Infrastructure/Hardware
- Containers are lightweight.
- Application and its dependencies are packaged as a single unit called container and deployed on container platform. It makes them reusable.
- Multiple packages can be deployed on a container platform and all of them use the same OS and same hardware. Unlike VM which has a guest OS.
- Orchestration - Making automated tasks work with each other in a sequence.
- Container orchestration - Kubernetes - Automatically handle container deployment, scaling, availability etc.
- Microservices built using different technologies, different frameworks can be packaged as separate containers and those multiple containers can be deployed on single container platform.
