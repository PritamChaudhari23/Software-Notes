PIPELINE AS CODE:

- Written in Jenkinsfile

Example

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        buildDiscarder(logRotator(daysToKeepStr: '10', numToKeepStr: '10'))
        timeout(time: 12, unit: 'HOURS')
        timestamps()
    }
    triggers {
          cron '@midnight'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Initialize') {
            steps {
                echo 'Initializing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }

        success {
            echo 'This will run only if the pipeline is successful'
        }
