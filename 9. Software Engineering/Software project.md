Shadowbox: Agile project
2 managers
QA team
Devloper team
2 devops
2 business analysts - (they are doctors)

Developers and testers must understand business requirements first. That is the source of knowledge for both. If both are on the same page only then the project can happen otherwise there will be miscommunication and conflicts between devs and QA.

===============================================================================================

- Explore the GitHub repo of any product or library. To know how company or open source technology works technically.
- Upgrading dependencies/libraries during ongoing project? Usually we don't upgrade to latest versions immediately, we wait for it to become stable?
- After PR is merged => Jenkins automated pipeline triggered => new build created and deployed on dev instance
- Write project documentation. MD file or story book. Developer guide. For new devs joining the team.
