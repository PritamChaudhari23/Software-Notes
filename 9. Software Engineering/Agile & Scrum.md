JIRA:

- User story => Story points => Fibonacci numbers
- For larger stories => split the ticket into two fibonnaci numbers
- Split a user story: 3 sub tasks - UI implementation, API integration, Testing
- Update the JIRA board on daily basis, checkin the code regularly.
- Close the story on JIRA after the PR is merged in main branch
