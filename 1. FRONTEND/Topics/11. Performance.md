WHEN USER VISITS A WEBSITE:

1. User enters the website name in browser URL bar. DNS resolution is done to findout the server IP and HTTP connection is made.
2. Browser send request to web server.
3. Server responds with single html file. It's index.html file, which contains minimal code with a div containing id="root" in which the virtual DOM is loaded. It also contains a script tag which loads the react javascript bundle - main.js
4. Browser downloads the javascript bundles and static assets like images, CSS, fonts etc.
5. Rendering and routing happens.
