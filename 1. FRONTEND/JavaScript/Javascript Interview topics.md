**TYPESCRIPT:**

- **TypeScript** is an **open-source programming language** developed by **Microsoft** and its **superset of JavaScript**.
- It offers **static typing**, so we explicitly declare data type which helps catch errors **before running the code**.
- **Type inference** helps automatically determine data type if not declared.
- **Interfaces** & **Type alias** helps to define the structure of objects and ensure consistency.
- **Object-Oriented Programming Support**: Classes, inheritance, access modifiers (public, private, protected), abstract classes.
- **Compile-Time Error Checking,** not at runtime.
- Modern JavaScript Support (ES6+) and excellent tooling and IDE support, Intellisense.
- It is compiled into **(transpiled)** into plain JavaScript using typescript compiler which browsers and JavaScript engines understand.
- TypeScript configuration of a project is stored in tsconfig.json file. Compilation: .ts (TypeScript file) => tsc (tsc compiler) => .js (JavaScript file)
- Current version: v5.9 (Dec 2025)

**REFERENCES**:

- In C or C++, pointers are used to show memory location of data. But in JavaScript, we cannot see the exact memory location of objects, arrays or primitives. This is because JavScript is a high level programming language and memory management is abstracted away from user.
- When we use = sign, we basically give a new name for array or object.

Example:

1. Object:

```JavaScript
// Object
const obj1 = { name: "Adam" };
const obj2 = obj1;

console.log(obj1 === obj2); // true → same reference
obj2.name = "Noah";
console.log(obj1.name);     // "Noah" → proves same underlying object
```

2. Array:

```JavaScript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = arr1;

arr2.push(4);

console.log(arr1); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(arr1 === arr2); // true
```

- We can prove the sameness with **reference equality** (`===`) and by observing **shared mutations**.
- But the referential equality applies to arrays and objects only, not primitives. For primitive data types, new copy gets created.
- Primitives are copied by value, objects are copied by reference.

Example:

```JavaScript
let x = 10;
let y = x; // copy, not reference
y = 20;

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 20
```

---

**this:**

- this is a keyword which gives reference to the object which is currently used in the function's execution context.
- It depends on how the function is called not just where its defined.
- call, bind and apply are use to set the value of this.

**call:**

- takes comma separated arguments
- sets the value of this and executes immediately

**apply:**

- takes array of arguments
- sets the value of this and executes immediately

**bind:**

- takes comma separated arguments
- sets the value of this and returns a function to execute later

Example:

```JavaScript
function greet(place, occasion) {
  console.log(`Hello ${this.name}, welcome to ${place} for the ${occasion}`);
}

const user = {
  name: "Adam",
  sayHi: function () {
    console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name}`);
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Hi, I am Adam → this = user

// call → arguments passed individually + executes immediately
greet.call(user, "Pune", "Tech Summit");

// apply → arguments passed as an array + executes immediately
greet.apply(user, ["Mumbai", "Product Launch"]);

// bind → arguments passed individually + returns a new function
const boundGreet = greet.bind(user, "Delhi", "Annual Conference");

boundGreet(); // executes later
```

Question: Why this does not work with arrow functions?

- Normal functions get the value of this from where the function gets called.
- Arrow functions do not have their own this, they inherit it from surrounding scope, as in where the function is defined.

**PROTOTYPES**:

Key points:

- In JavaScript everything apart from primitive datatypes - object, array and even function is an object.
- Objects can be created using { } but then they cannot share logic. Functions which are created without new don't create any object.
- Objects can be created by constructor functions using new.

Q1. Explain prototypes in JavaScript?

- Prototype is a mechanism in javascript by which multiple objects can reuse shared logic and they can also inherit features from other objects.
- When we create an object using a constructor function with new, that object gets a link to the constructor's prototype object.
- We can add different methods and properties on the prototype.

Q2. Can you give a code example?

```JavaScript
function Person(name,age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greetUser = function () {
  console.log(`Welcome ${this.name}`)
}

const p1 = new Person('Adam', 25);
const p2 = new Person('Noah', 15);

p1.greetUser();
p2.greetUser();
```

Q3. Whats the difference between .prototype and \_ _ proto _ \_?

- prototype is a property which exists on constructor function.
- \_ _ proto _ \_ is a property which exists on new object which is created.

Example:

```JavaScript
console.log(Person.prototype === p1.__proto__) // true
```

Q4. How inheritance works in JavaScript using prototype?

```JavaScript
function Animal(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
}

Animal.prototype.eat = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} is eating`);
};


function Horse(name, color) {
  Animal.call(this, name, color);
}

Horse.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

Horse.prototype.run = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} is running`);
};


const horse1 = new Horse("Thunder", "Brown");

console.log(horse1.name);  // Thunder
console.log(horse1.color); // Brown

horse1.eat(); // Thunder is eating
horse1.run(); // Thunder is running
```

Q5. How is class syntax using prototype behind the scenes?

```JavaScript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greetUser() {
    console.log(`Welcome ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const p = new Person("Adam", 25);
```

**HOISTING:**

- Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where declarations of variables and functions are processed before code execution. During the memory allocation (creation phase), JavaScript allocates memory for variables and functions before executing the code.
- If a variable is declared inside a function, its scope is limited to that function, which means it cannot be accessed outside of that function. If it is outside, then it has a global scope; it can be accessed anywhere.
- var is function scoped, let and const are block scoped.
- Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
- var variables are hoisted and initialized with undefined.
- let and const variables are hoisted but not initialized.
- Hoisting does work with let and const, but they are placed in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the time between the start of a scope and the declaration of a let or const variable, during which accessing it throws a ReferenceError. Accessing them before their declaration results in a ReferenceError (not undefined).

```javascript
1.var
	console.log(a);
	var a = 10;
	Output: undefined

2.let/const
	console.log(b);
	let b = 20;
	Output: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization

3.Function declaration hoisting
	sayHello();

	function sayHello() {
 		console.log("Hello");
	}
	Output: Hello

4.Function expression with var
	sayHi();

	var sayHi = function () {
 		console.log("Hi");
	};
	Output: TypeError: sayHi is not a function

5.Block scope (let)
	{
 		console.log(x);
 		let x = 5;
	}

	Output: ReferenceError
```
