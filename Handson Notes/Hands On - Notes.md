ngrok:

- Its a tool, a cross platform tunneling application that lets us expose local development server to internet through secure tunnels.
- It creates a secure public URL for a local server. So developers can run a web app on localhost:3000 and instantly get a public URL like https://abcd1234.ngrok.io to share with others.
- Devs use it to share, test and debug applications running on local machines without deploying them to a public server.
