RESUME MENTION:

* Overview: Desktop application in healthcare domain. Used to integrate EHR with different diagnostic Labs and LIS systems for placing the lab test order of patients.
* Technology: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, HIPPA training
* Responsibilities:
  1. Lab requisition form development and testing, patient HL7 data mapping.
  2. Implement functionality using Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.
  3. Implement REST API using Node.js and Express to consume in frontend app.
  4. Write queries to store, retrieve, and modify patient data in Mongo DB for labs.
  5. Discuss solutions and blockers in daily stand-up meetings with the US client.

WORK FLOW UNDERSTANDING:

Usecase:

* This is actually a startup in US healthcare market and their primary use case was integrating EHR and Labs.
* EHR is Electronic Health Record or Elctronic Medical Record. A digital version of a patient’s medical history, including diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunizations, allergies, lab results, and clinical notes. EHRs are designed to be shared across different healthcare settings.
* Labs: Refers to clinical laboratories that perform diagnostic tests (blood, urine, pathology, microbiology, etc.) and the test results they generate for patient care. Labs can use HL7 data format or API.
* LIS: A specialized software system used by laboratories to manage lab workflows, including test ordering, specimen tracking, result entry, quality control, and reporting. LIS typically integrates with EHR/EMR systems to send results to clinicians.
* User Portal: Select EHR + Lab/LIS, add pod configuration
* Every lab will have its own db instance where it stores orders and lab results.
* Orders were stored in a SFTP server.

**Labs** –  **Laboratory Services / Laboratory Data** :

Flow:

1. An API call is made to EHR to fetch HL7 data of the patient.
2. Browser renders the form.
3. Patient data is mapped and populated on static form sections and test panel for selected lab is displayed in dynamic section.
4. User selects the tests and submits the form. Lab order is placed, the form is processed in backend and data is saved in db.
5. Lab results are available for any given order in a few days.

LEARNINGS:

1] Views:

- Every form has static and dynamic part.
- Static part has sections which are common across all the lab forms.
- Dynamic part has sections which are specific to a particular lab such as test sections which the lab can offer.
- EJS has this syntax like <%= .... %> where in we can write javascript code.
- Form validation??

2] Controllers:

3] Models:Entities in DB:

* Patients
* Lab orders - Of patients
* Lab results - Of patients
