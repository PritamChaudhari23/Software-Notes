44. It does the computations
45. This is critical

49. Something funky is happening here
50. I have a hard stop at 3:15
51. But when I work with the business people, They are 'speaking a completely different language'. They are talking about sales and supply chain and logistics etc. which I don't understand
52. lets commit a stable code. Ensure that the code is stable before commiting
53. Usecase - We have such a usecase
54. And add more colours to it....
55. Is there a smart way of doing this?
56. Let's make sure while fixing something, we are not breaking something else
57. This is a quick fix
58. You see what I did there!!!!!!!
59. Tonda vr padne infront of client
60. Half baked code
61. Cosmetic changes
62. Bug leakage
63. QA Signoff
64. Be careful with the wording when talking to client
65. QA will catch this!!
66. I will release it to QA
67. Functional issues, UI issues
68. Patches maarne padenge!!!! - Jugaad, Dirty solution
69. This is the problem statement
70. We have a dependency on - Dependency on another person or on something which can cause delay in deliverables
71. Action items
72. Wanted to highlight this ....
73. Do the heavylifting
74. Steps to reproduce the bug
75. We have a blocker. Blocker - Something due to which you get stopped and cannot work furthur.
76. Will work on it paralelly.
77. Give the RCA (Root Cause Analysis) for this
78. Reopen the bug....
79. This is not a showstopper
80. Intermittent issue
81. My code will be overwritten by his code.
82. Keep this issue under observation.
83. Need to investigate/ research more on this
84. Bug - The affected area in the feature
85. Are you on the call?/Are you on the line?
86. No code changes are required for this task.
87. Expedite the development
88. Spaghetti code
89. This is an iterative process
90. Refactor the code
91. Micromanage - We'll have to micromanage this a little.
92. let's have proper error handling
93. The reason why this confusion happened is
94. Track the status of this/ track the issue..
95. Live data - Data in production
96. Legacy codebase - A project repository which uses old versions, older outdated syntax, just the maintainence work is done now. It can be refactored with new version and syntax.
97. Known issues
98. Edge case
99. I have somethings to discuss around that (around that point or topic)
